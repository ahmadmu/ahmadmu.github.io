== Purpose of this Document

This document represents the Software Requirements Specification (SRS, German: close to a "Pflichtenheft") of the project **{project_name}**.
It aims to provide an overview of the software product to be built and functions as a basis for communication between
the stakeholders of the project, mainly the client and the development team.
It is desired to have this document as the foundation for a contract between the
client and the contractor, and should therefore be validated and checked for consistency.
The SRS describes _what_ the desired system has to fulfill and _partially how_ the contractor intends to implement the solution.

== Task Definition

IT- Dienstleister CompuTech
Die Firma CompuTech beliefert seine Kunden mit PC-Komplettsystemen sowie mit Zubehör und Verbrauchsmaterialien (CDs, Druckerpatronen, Toner, etc.). Die Firma kennt zwei Arten von Kunden, Privat - und Geschäftskunden(B2C & B2B). Ein neues IT-System soll die Beziehung zum Kunden vereinfachen und einen Wettbewerbsvorteil für seine Geschäftskunden bieten.

Geschäftskunden können, wenn sie angemeldet sind, Bestellungen (nur Erweiterungen von Bestehender Hardware oder Upgrade) aufgeben sowie ihren derzeitigen EDV-Bestand einsehen. In der Bestandsanzeige soll der Kunde Geräte auswählen und mit Reparatur- oder Serviceaufträgen versehen können. Keine Aktion geschieht ohne Auftrag! Geschäftskunden werden von einem Mitarbeiter angelegt und mit einem vorläufigen Kennwort versehen welches der Kunde danach ändern kann.

Privatkunden können sich selbst am System anmelden. Eine Überprüfung der Email und Postadresse (ähnlich Web.de) kann helfen die Gültigkeit einer Adresse zu prüfen. Hat sich der Kunde angemeldet so ist es ihm möglich sein, aus einer vorgegebenen Auswahl von Geräten ein Basismodell auszuwählen und dieses nach seinen Wünschen zu konfigurieren. Privatkunden sollen zudem die Möglichkeit bekommen gebrauchte Geräte wieder an CompuTech verkaufen zu können.

Jeder Geschäftskunde hat einen bestimmten Verkaufsleiter als Ansprechpartner. Dieser wird zugeordnet wenn der Verkaufsleiter den Geschäftskunden in der Datenbank anlegt. Der Verkaufsleiter nimmt alle eingehenden Bestellungen und Serviceanfragen entgegen prüft diese und erstellt dann einen Auftrag an das Lager und den Service. Zudem entscheidet der Verkaufsleiter, zu welchem Preis Geräte von Privatkunden zurückgekauft werden.

Das Lager verwaltet den Bestand aller Geräte und Verbrauchsmaterialien. Für alle Posten gibt es Mindestbestände. Werden diese unterschritten, bestellt das Lager automatisch aus einer Auswahl von Händlern zu den günstigsten Konditionen nach. Geht ein Auftrag von einem Verkaufsleiter ein, stellt das Lager die Bestellung zusammen (Kommissionierung) und erstellt dann einen Auftrag für den Versand, welcher sich dann um Auslieferung und Aufstellung der Gerät kümmert. Für den letzten Punkt muss ein Auftrag für den Service erstellt werden.

Das System soll zudem ein „Kassenbuch“ führen, welches die Buchhaltung und den Jahresabschluss vereinfachen soll. Hierzu sollen alle Transaktionen gespeichert und nach bestimmten Filterkriterien gedruckt werden können. Auf diese Daten hat natürlich nur der Geschäftsführer und die Buchhaltung Zugriff.

Dem Kunden ist es besonders wichtig, dass seine Geschäftsprozesse von dem zu entwickelnden IT-System vollständig abgebildet werden.

== Product Usage

This section is going to give an overview of how the product is intended to be used upon completion and under which circumstances.

The system is going to be used as a web shop by the company CompuTech to sell computers, equipments and computer consumables.
The software is supposed to run on a server and be available through the internet (via a browser) to interested customers 24/7.

The system shall be accessible and visually optimized for the following browsers:

- Mozilla Firefox, version 55.0.3+
- Google Chrome, version 61.0.3163+

The primary users of the software are other businesses, private customers, the company's employees, as well as administrators (Boss),
who do not necessarily have a technical background.

The system shall not need technical maintenance, as the staff of the CompuTech already has its hands full.
Any data shall be stored persistently in a database and be accessible through the application (e.g. no SQL knowledge should be required for a boss).

== Stakeholders
Here is every group or individual (real or juristical) listed, which/who has an impact on the requirements of the system.
In the below table, these stakeholders are listed, a priority is assigned (in case requirements should clash this allows for easier decisions)
and their high-level goals are described.
The assigned priorities range from 1 (lowest priority) to 5 (highest priority).

== System Boundaries and Component Structure

=== System Context Diagram

The system context diagram shows the planned system in its environment.
This includes all user types, their ways to access the system, as well as third-party systems, which
access our system or are accessed by it (not the case here).

== Use-Cases

This section will give an overview of the use cases the system has to support.
These use cases describe what functionality the system has to provide (mostly) from the client's point of view and which actors are involved.

=== Actors

Actors are users of the system or neighboring systems who/which access it.
The following table summarizes all actors of the system and provides a description of the actor.
Abstract actors (i.e. an actor which groups other actors, written in _italic_) are used to generalize and group.

=== Concrete Not-Functional Requirements

Beschreiben Sie Nicht-Funktionale Anforderungen, welche dazu dienen, die zuvor definierten Qualitätsziele zu erreichen.
Achten Sie darauf, dass deren Erfüllung (mindestens theoretisch) messbar sein muss.

== GUI Prototype

The following pictures show what the GUI of the system could look like.

=== Overview: Dialogue Map

image::./models/analysis/gui-img/dialoglandkarte.PNG[Dialoglandkarte]

=== Dialogue Description
The first page is the main landing page. Here you can login with your account
or create a private customer account. In the screenshot you can see the top bar
which is used as the main navigation tool. From there you can use links to get
to every page of the system, if your account has the permission for it.

image::./models/analysis/gui-img/gui_1.png[Login]

This a screenshot of our shop templatei it features clickable product-cards.
If you click on one of the product-cards you will be taken to a site with
productdetails.

image::./models/analysis/gui-img/gui_2.png[Shop]

Below is the site with the product details. In the shop you choose a base model
and here you can coustomize things like memory and ram.

image::./models/analysis/gui-img/gui_3.png[Produktdetail]

Here is a screenshot of our list template it is used in the EDV-Bestand but also
for the order list the sales manager approves and his buisiness customer list and so on.
In this example though  it only shows the systems brought by one account and gives the
customer the option to upgrade or request a service/repair.
